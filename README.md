# 🏊 Project: Piscine Reloaded

## Overview

`Piscine Reloaded` serves as a **foundational revision and consolidation project** for the core skills learned during the initial C Piscine (or similar intensive program). Its primary goal is to ensure a solid grasp of fundamental development tools, C language basics, and project submission workflows.

The project involves implementing a series of small C functions and demonstrating competency with essential Unix tools.
